# Executive Summary

Determining license and vulnerability results are important because of how many open source projects there are out there today. If a developer sends a package that has issues, the developer and manager want to know that. 

This system can do multiple things. Starting off, the developer can send a software package to be scanned for license results as well as be sent to the NIST Vulnerability Database to be checked for vulnerabilities. These results are then sent to the License and Vulnerability Results Database. Both the developer and manager can then query the database by package name to receive the license and vulnerability results. Only the manager can create or edit a policy by adding it to the policy database. The manager can also apply a policy to a package name and receive the policy info back.
