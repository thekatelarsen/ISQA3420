# Executive Summary

Determining license and vulnerability results are important because of how many open source projects are out there today. Using open source has many benefits which include reducing the amount of development needed, less bugs and better functionality. The main issue with open ource is the security of the software. If a developer sends a package the the system and the package has issues, the developer and manager want to know that. This is why having a system to determine licenses and vulnerabilities would be beneficial.

This system's overall goal is to determine if the software package that the company will use has any issues with licensing and vulnerabilities. Starting off, the developer can send a software package to be scanned for license results as well as be sent to the NIST Vulnerability Database to be checked for vulnerabilities. These results are then sent to the License and Vulnerability Results Database. Both the developer and manager can then query the database by package name to receive the license and vulnerability results. Only the manager can create or edit a policy by adding it to the policy database. The manager can also apply a policy to a package name and receive the policy info back.
